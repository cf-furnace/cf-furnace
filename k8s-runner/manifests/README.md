# Kubernetes Definitions

Kubernetes defines services, replication controllers, volumes, secrests
and other entities inside of _definitions_. They are encoded either as
JSON files or YAML files.  The yaml file here allows a docker image to be built based on the droplet, user's namespace and the base stack.
